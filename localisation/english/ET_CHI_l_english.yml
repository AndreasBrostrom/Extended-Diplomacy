 ET_CHI.1.t:0 "Liu Xiang Died"
 ET_CHI.1.desc:0 "As tragic as it is, Liu Xiang's death provides a swift opportunity for us to seize and annex the land of Sichuan, it is our land after all. So perhaps it would be in our best interests to annex it in the midst of the Sino-Japanese war and the fiasco in leadership following Liu Xiang's death in Sichuan."
 ET_CHI.1.a:0 "Send our condolences, and annex them."
 ET_CHI.2.t:0 "Annexing The Northeast Army"
 ET_CHI.2.desc:0 "With the incorporation of the Chinese Communist Party into the united front, there is no longer a need for the Northeast army to continue suppressing the communists, they're our ally now for atleast anyway. Regardless we should keep an eye on them to ensure they don't stay out of line, these dastardly communists should know their place in this upcoming war."
 ET_CHI.2.a:0 "Welcome Back Zhang....?"
