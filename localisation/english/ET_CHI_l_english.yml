 ET_CHI.1.t:0 "Liu Xiang Died"
 ET_CHI.1.desc:0 "As tragic as it is, Liu Xiang's death provides a swift opportunity for us to seize and annex the land of Sichuan, it is our land after all. So perhaps it would be in our best interests to annex it in the midst of the Sino-Japanese war and the fiasco in leadership following Liu Xiang's death in Sichuan."
 ET_CHI.1.a:0 "Send our condolences, and annex them."
